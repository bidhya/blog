# Installation of GPU to work with Tensorflow for Deep Learning for Windows 10  
Even though installation of Tensorflow is more streamlined (even on Windows), there are still few nuances on uisng GPU. Here are the steps to using GPU with tensorflow.  
Refere to this [page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) for specific GPU version of sofware/driver  
**Important** : Make sure to download the exact version specified on google site. Since, there is rapid updates to both tensorflow and nvidia
downloading the latest NVIDIA drivers will not work.  

Software and Drivers
The following NVIDIA® software must be installed on your system:  

NVIDIA® GPU drivers —CUDA® 10.1 requires 418.x or higher.  
    Choose the GPU driver matching your GPU, search, download, and install  
CUDA® Toolkit —TensorFlow supports CUDA® 10.1 (TensorFlow >= 2.1.0)
    Search, download, and install (size > 2 GB)
CUPTI ships with the CUDA® Toolkit: This should already be installed with cuda toolkit installation  
cuDNN SDK 7.6
    Need to make an account, login, then download and unzip to folder (C:/tools/)  
(Optional) TensorRT 6.0 to improve latency and throughput for inference on some models.  
    Download and unzip to same folder (C:/tools/)  

## Set paths with environment variables [either user or system will work, but I prefer system path]
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.1\bin  
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.1\extras\CUPTI\lib64  
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.1\include  
C:\tools\cuda\bin  
C:\tools\TensorRT-6.0.1.5 (optional)
